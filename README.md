This is my submission project for Udacity's React Redux course for the "Readable" project.
  
## Installation

Installation is done with npm or yarn. To install all required dependencies, type in the console:

`npm install`

or

`yarn install`

This will start the live reload server and open the app in the browser. The URL is displayed in the command prompt as well. 

## Installation of Backend Server

This project requires a separate installation of a backend server. The backend server is available as a separate installation here:

https://github.com/fade2g/reactnd-project-readable-starter

In order to start the backend, the following instructions apply:

1. clone or download the server repository
1. `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the depenedncies
1. `yarn start` or `node server.js` to start the backend server

by default, the server will run on port `5001`. This is **exepected from the readable frontend application** as well.

The backend server has been minimally modified from the original clone available from here: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter  As ist cannot be controlled that the "public" server API will stay in sync with the server API expected from the frontend application, it is recommended to use the forked backend server. 


## Start
To start the frontend server for the app, type in the console:

`npm start`

or

`yarn start`

The application will launch by default on port `3000`, so it will be available under http://localhost:3000/
